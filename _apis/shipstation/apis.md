description: >-
  A shipping API offers a robust, customizable solution to the challenges of
  shipping. Ultimately, a shipping API is a group of APIs that can be used
  individually or together to accomplish tasks such as generating labels,
  retrieving rates, producing end of day forms, and updating tracking. There’s
  no need to go through the tedious process of directly integrating your
  website/OMS with carriers individually. Let’s take a closer look at a shipping
  API’s key features and its benefits. ~
