    ## Authentication


    Authentication and identification to the EasyPost API is done by providing
    an API Key on every request as your Basic Auth username (no password is
    required). EasyPost requires that all communication with the API is secured
    using TLS v1.2. Requests made over HTTP or without a proper API Key will
    fail.


    EasyPost provides two types of API Key: Test and Production. You can test
    all EasyPost functionality using your Test key, for free, immediately after
    signing up.


    You can manage your API Keys from your account.


    Treat your API Keys as passwords—keep them secret. API Keys give full
    read/write access to your account, so they should not be included in public
    repositories, emails, client side code, etc. If yours gets leaked, you can
    disable it on the dashboard's API Keys Page.


    Here is an image from the postman docs showing how you can select your
    authorization type (select basic auth):

    ## EasyPost Objects


    The EasyPost API consists of many object types. There are several attributes
    that are consistent across all objects:


    id: Every EasyPost Object that can be created through the API has an id
    field that is used to refer to the object in other API calls. An id consists
    of a prefix based on the object type (e.g. Shipments have the prefix "shp_")
    followed by 32 hex characters. These id values may be used in many API
    endpoints to refer to an existing object rather than specifying the full
    object definition; for instance in Shipment creation, you may specify the
    to_address either with all fields (street1, city, zip, etc.) filled, or you
    may reuse an existing Address by specifying only the id field value as the
    matching Address's id, omitting all other fields.

    object: Every first-class EasyPost object includes an object value. This can
    be useful for identifying the types of nested objects, or for cases like
    webhook Events which can contain many different types of result. For objects
    where there are many variant types, such as Fees, the object value
    represents the supertype, and the type represents the subtype for that
    object.

    reference: Many API objects also have an optional reference field that may
    be assigned during creation. The reference values you assign may be used in
    place of id values in many API endpoints, but we recommend using the
    EasyPost-assigned id instead because ids are guaranteed to be unique within
    the system, while reference uniqueness is not enforced. If your system does
    not enforce uniqueness on the references you submit, this may result in the
    wrong one of many objects with the same reference being picked in EasyPost's
    handling of your API request.

    created_at/updated_at: Most API objects also include values for created_at
    and updated_at. These two fields respectively specify the time the object in
    question was created and most recently updated. These datetime fields are
    formatted according to ISO 8601.

    ## Errors


    In the event of a client or server error, the response will contain the
    standard 4xx or 5xx respectively, accompanied by a well-formed JSON body
    describing the issue, e.g., a required field was omitted, a purchase failed,
    etc.


    Each client library will encapsulate these errors and raise an exception, in
    addition to other exceptional cases, such as network failures. It is
    recommended to handle exceptions gracefully and to report any issues to
    support@easypost.com.

      ## Addresses

      Address objects are used to represent people, places, and organizations in
      a number of contexts. For example, a Shipment requires a to_address and
      from_address to accurately calculate rates and generate postage.


      Additionally, EasyPost offers several verification tools that can be used
      to detect deliverability issues, correct minor errors in
      spelling/formatting, and determine if an Address is residential or not
      (which has a significant effect on Shipment rating for many carriers).
  - name: Basics > Parcels
    description: >-
      https://www.easypost.com/docs/api#parcels


      Parcel objects represent the physical container being shipped. Dimensions
      can be supplied either as length, width, and height dimensions, or a
      predefined_package string. Only weight is required, but since many
      carriers charge different rates for packages with large dimensions, we
      strongly recommend including all dimensions if available.


      Weights are in OUNCES (OZ) and go to one decimal point.


      Dimensions are in INCHES (IN) and go to one decimal point.
  - name: Basics > Insurances
    description: >-
      https://www.easypost.com/docs/api#insurance


      ## Insurances

      An Insurance object represents insurance for packages purchased both via
      the EasyPost API as well as shipments purchased through third parties and
      later registered with EasyPost. An Insurance is created automatically
      whenever you buy a Shipment through EasyPost and pass insurance options
      during the Buy call or in a later call to Insure a Shipment.


      Insurance purchased through the Shipment Buy or Insure endpoints is
      immediately insured - there is no possibility of rejection based on
      tracking information, as the package was just created. On the other hand,
      Insurance purchased on shipments purchased outside of EasyPost requires
      creation with a tracking code so that EasyPost may confirm the package
      existence and current shipping status at the time of purchase.


      Standalone insurance is created in a pending state to help distinguish it
      from insurance purchased for an EasyPost Shipment. Both kinds of Insurance
      use the Tracking system to receive periodic updates, and will report those
      updates to any appropriate Webhooks on file. Standalone insurance will
      cancel itself if the tracking information for the given tracking code
      shows evidence of having been shipped anytime before the insurance was
      purchased.


      Unlike Shipments within EasyPost, Insurance objects register To and From
      Address objects according to the destination and ship-from locations of
      the package. This means that a Shipment with "is_return: true" actually
      ships to the listed From Address. Insurance does not have a concept of
      "is_return", so all insurance records refer to their true package
      destination as "to_address", regardless of whether or not the shipment is
      a return.

      ## Shipments

      The workhorse of the EasyPost API, a Shipment is made up of a "to" and
      "from" Address, the Parcel being shipped, and any customs forms required
      for international deliveries. Once created a Shipment object is used to
      retrieve shipping Rates and purchase a label.


      A Shipment created with a valid to_address, from_address, and parcel will
      automatically populate its rates attribute.
  - name: Basics > Rates
    description: "After a\_**Shipment**\_is successfully created, it will automatically fetch\_**Rates**. You can limit the\_**CarrierAccounts**\_to use for rating by passing the\_*carrier_accounts*\_parameter upon\_**Shipment**\_creation.\n\nThere are three rate types: the actual rate that will be purchased,\_*rate*\_and\_*currency*, the published non-discounted rate,\_*list_rate*\_and\_*list_currency*, and the rate if purchased from the post office,\_*retail_rate*\_and\_*retail_currency*."
  - name: Basics > Trackers
    description: "A\_**Tracker**\_object contains all of the tracking information for a package. A\_**Tracker**\_is created automatically whenever you buy a\_**Shipment**\_through EasyPost; if you don’t use EasyPost to purchase your shipping labels, you can still track packages through our API by creating a\_**Tracker**\_object directly. Each\_**Tracker**\_is continually updated in the background as the package moves through its life cycle, regardless of whether or not the label was purchased through EasyPost.\n\nAfter creation, a\_**Tracker**\_object will be updated periodically based on when the carrier provides EasyPost with new tracking information. This information can be consumed by using our\_[webhooks](https://www.easypost.com/docs/api#events)\_infrastructure. Every time a\_**Tracker**\_is updated a webhook\_**Event**\_will be sent.\n\nThe\_**Tracker**\_object contains both the current information about the package as well as previous updates. All of the previous updates are stored in the\_*tracking_details*\_array. Each\_**TrackingDetail**\_object contains the\_*status*, the\_*message*\_from the carrier, and a\_**TrackingLocation**.\n\nThe\_**TrackingLocation**\_contains\_*city*,\_*state*,\_*country*, and\_*zip*\_information about the location where the package was scanned. The information each carrier provides is different, so some carriers may not make use of all of these fields.\n\nSome\_**Tracker**\_objects may also contain a\_**CarrierDetail**, which stores some additional information about the\_**Tracker**\_that the carrier has made available to EasyPost. The\_**CarrierDetail**\_object contains the\_*service*\_and\_*container_type*\_of the package. Additionally, it also stores the\_*est_delivery_date_local*\_and\_*est_delivery_time_local*, which provide information about the local delivery time.\n\nIt's worth noting that\_*tracking_codes*\_are not globally unique. Each carrier promises uniqueness for a given\_*tracking_code*\_for a certain period of time, but the length of time varies greatly based on the specific carrier and service level. The carriers do eventually recycle\_*tracking_codes*, and for this reason enforcing uniqueness on the\_*tracking_code*\_field is not recommended. EasyPost does, however, prevent the creation of duplicate\_**Trackers**\_based on\_*tracking_code*\_and\_*carrier*; duplicate requests by the same\_**User**\_will simply return the original\_**Tracker**."

      The User object can be used to manage your own account and to create child

      against the Users API.


      There are two kinds of accounts. The first is the standard (parent) User
      object. It represents your account state, settings, and credentials to log
      in via the website. The second is the child User, which is a User that
      belongs to a parent.


      Balance and recharge values on User objects are expressed in higher
      precision USD.
